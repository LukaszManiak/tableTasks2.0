## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

TableTasks is a feature-rich todo application that empowers users with a wide range of functionalities to manage their tasks efficiently. The application is designed to be user-friendly, allowing users to customize their task management experience seamlessly.

## ðŸ§  Why This App?

This project was created as a personal learning tool to solidify my understanding of modern frontend development practices. The main technologies used in this project include:

- **TypeScript** â€“ To improve type safety, catch errors earlier, and write more maintainable code.
- **TanStack Router** â€“ To explore a modern, type-safe, file-based routing solution for React apps.
- **TanStack Query** â€“ For efficient data fetching, caching, and syncing with server state.
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ To rapidly build responsive and styled components with utility-first CSS.

## Goal

TableTasks was developed with a singular focus: to empower individuals in effectively managing their tasks and projects. As a feature-rich todo application, it goes beyond the basic functionalities, aiming to provide a comprehensive solution for organizing and tracking tasks.
